    title:  Computer Science Students' Association
    text:   KSI (Xi) - fourteenth letter of Greek alphabet (which you will learn at introduction to set theory) on our university gained special meaning. This symbol means Computer Science Students' Association (<strong>K</strong>o&#322;o <strong>S</strong>tudent√≥w <strong>I</strong>nformatyki - KSI=Xi) - organization, which should be known by every computer science student (and not only!). Since 1976 we unite creative and curious people who don't want to limit themselves only to mandatory classes.

    text:   If you are looking for place where, in peace, you can solder, <strike>saw</strike>, screw, unscrew, diagnose your hardware, set up server, build 3D printer or realize your own idea - come to our Project&nbsp;Center&nbsp;(room&nbsp;1166).

  section_didactics:
    title:  Learn with KSI
    text:   Studies is also time when you can... learn something ;) KSI helps you in that - not only by giving space when you can learn in group to colloquium but also by organizing workshops and training courses - eg. Ruby on Rails, Git or softskills.  If you have difficulties with learning something for studies - in KSI there is definitely someone who've already passed that subject and is willing to help you!

  sfi_name: SFI Academic IT Festival
  sfi_text: An international IT conference organized by students, for students. Since 2005, in cooperation with students' associations from 3 other Krakow universities and academies, every year we invite lecturers from all over the world. The list of our former speakers includes Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Thomas Cormen, Larry Wall, Richard Stallman and Kevin Warwick. During the three days of conference dozens of lectures and workshops take place, that attract attention of several thousands of participants every year. Financially speaking, it is absolutely free. The only ticket you will ever need is passion and interest.
  ksitalk: ksiTalk is our monthly student seminar. The purpose of regular meetings is sharing knowledge, broadening horizons in the field of Computer Science and polishing rhetorical skills necessary in scientific career. On every seminar a lecture is conducted by an invited researcher, as to let students establish closer contact with science and potentially begin scientific collaboration. Afterwards at least two members of KSI present their own science projects, interesting issues or thought-provoking science papers.
  corp_name: Lectures and workshops in cooperation with IT companies
  corp_desc: At KSI we understand the importance of cooperation between science and business.
  ksicamp: Specially for first year students we dedicate a series of weekend workshops, introducing them to programming, programmers' toolkit and team project development. Taking part in ksiCamp allows you to swiftly start your Computer Science studies and gives an opportunity to practice your newly acquired knowledge by solving real-world problems.
  ksilearn: 'KSILearn is a series of weekly meetings for the members of KSI. The purpose is sharing knowledge and broadening horizons in the fields of Computer Science that are not part of the courses the students can take part in during their studies. So far, we have started courses about the following topics: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Category theory, Cracking the Coding Interview, and Programming in Python for beginners.'
