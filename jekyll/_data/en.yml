  sfi_name: SFI Academic IT Festival
  sfi_text: An international IT conference organized by students, for students. Since 2005, in cooperation with students' associations from 3 other Krakow universities and academies, every year we invite lecturers from all over the world. The list of our former speakers includes Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Thomas Cormen, Larry Wall, Richard Stallman and Kevin Warwick. During the three days of conference dozens of lectures and workshops take place, that attract attention of several thousands of participants every year. Financially speaking, it is absolutely free. The only ticket you will ever need is passion and interest.
  ksitalk: ksiTalk is our monthly student seminar. The purpose of regular meetings is sharing knowledge, broadening horizons in the field of Computer Science and polishing rhetorical skills necessary in scientific career. On every seminar a lecture is conducted by an invited researcher, as to let students establish closer contact with science and potentially begin scientific collaboration. Afterwards at least two members of KSI present their own science projects, interesting issues or thought-provoking science papers.
