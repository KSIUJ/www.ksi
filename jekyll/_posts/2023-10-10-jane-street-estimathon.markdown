Want to learn more about careers in Quantitative Finance and what quantitative traders and software engineers do at Jane Street? Join us for an introduction to Jane Street talk including a run through of an example interview question. 
This talk will be followed by the Estimathon game — a team-based contest that combines trivia, game theory and mathematical thinking. In teams of 6, you will be tasked with solving 13 estimation problems in just 30 minutes. 

At Jane Street, we love food and swag! So you can expect there to be pizza and swag here too.
